Description
This repository contains Python programs, lux.py and luxserver.py, designed for people to query a collection of objects and artwork stored in the Yale University Art Gallery (YUAG) database. The program aims to provide a simple GUI for museum visitors and other interested parties to query the database and retrieve detailed information. 

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine 
Ensure you have Python installed on your system 
Navigate to the repository directory and execute the desired program using the provided usage instructions. 
Usage
To run ‘lux.py’ and query the objects in YUAG collection, use the following command: 
python3 lux.py localhost 8080

To run ‘luxserver.py’ and retrieve details for a specific object, use the following command: 
python3 luxserver.py 8080

Roadmap
This program acts as the final iteration to a semester long endeavor to build a sophisticated Yale University Art Gallery Database Query Interface. This program has built on the previous ones and improved its visuals and features in iterations.

Authors and acknowledgment
Team Contributions 
This program was built by Tracy Li and Sianna Xiao for the CPSC 419 Full Stack Web Programming class Pset 4 over the course of two weeks. We mainly made small adjustments in code structures and added a few new features. Tracy took care of the search page and Sianna took care of the object page. Furthermore, Tracy debugged css file loading errors and Sianna finished the remaining pieces, ran pylint, and wrote this readme. Tracy then reviewed and submitted. 
Support Received from Other People:
We mostly referred to class powerpoints, online documentation, and sample code for help. We didn’t go to office hours for this assignment. 

Sources of Information We Used:
We referred to the class slides and online resources such as W3Schools, ChatGPT, and other Python documentation to learn and practice programming in Python for this assignment. Since this assignment was built on top of Pset 1/2/3, we also frequently referred back to the script as well as grading results from these previous psets. 

Time 
The estimated time spent on this assignment is 11 hours over the course of two weeks. 

Assignment Assessment 

This assignment was a great final iteration to solidify our understanding of full stack web development during this course. It was rewarding to be able to build on top of the previous problem sets in iterations and produce a final version of this web application that is visibly more sophisticated and satisfying. Furthermore, this assignment also solidified our understanding of Flask and client server interaction. We found it to be quite similar to the previous iteration, which was problem set 3, so again some learning outcomes regarding this were flask frameworks, form handling, data presentation, and error handling. We again also solidified our learning on client side logic, SQL and databases, as well as HTML and CSS.
